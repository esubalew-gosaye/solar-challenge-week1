## üìì Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks used for exploring, analyzing, and modeling the solar radiation and environmental dataset collected from three countries.


## üìÅ Notebook Descriptions

- **togo_eda.ipynb** Performs exploratory data analysis on Togo's dataset, including summary statistics, missing value inspection, outlier detection using Z-scores, and basic data cleaning. It analyzes solar radiation trends over time, evaluates the impact of cleaning events, explores correlations, visualizes wind and temperature distributions, and exports a cleaned dataset to **data/cleaned/togo_clean.csv**

- **benin_eda.ipynb** Performs exploratory data analysis on Benin's dataset, including summary statistics, missing value inspection, outlier detection using Z-scores, and basic data cleaning. It analyzes solar radiation trends over time, evaluates the impact of cleaning events, explores correlations, visualizes wind and temperature distributions, and exports a cleaned dataset to **data/cleaned/benin_clean.csv**

- **sierraleone_eda.ipynb** Performs exploratory data analysis on Sierraleone's dataset, including summary statistics, missing value inspection, outlier detection using Z-scores, and basic data cleaning. It analyzes solar radiation trends over time, evaluates the impact of cleaning events, explores correlations, visualizes wind and temperature distributions, and exports a cleaned dataset to **data/cleaned/sierraleone_clean.csv**
